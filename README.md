# operation_kill_command
Web app to track and plan workouts based on my own training principles. Currently can only be spun up using a local node.js server.

To do:
- Remove begin workout button after pressing it
- Allow user to "Uncommit" a workout and remove it from the session if they decide to
- Make input boxes look nicer. Stack them and order them
- Display new goal from JSON log
- Update exercise last performed date once the user commits it
- Default empty inputs after commit to 0 if no input
- Add a second add exercise button that appears after the user begins their workout to add more input boxes
- Put rest timer buttons on each exercise (customizable)
- Add a page for manual log entries
- Add a page for instructions
- Consider repurposing the more complicated concepts with Python and Django or Flask
